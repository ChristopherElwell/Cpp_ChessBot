// by the opposing side to determine if the king is in check or if castling is legal (to be optimized)
// the search function first allocates an arrays of Move structs an the stack then passes a pointer into those interfacing functions. Each Piece for that side is then
// called to fill the array with its moves, passing in a movptr to each function that is iterated as the array is filled to keep track of the next empty spot
